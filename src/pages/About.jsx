              <h2>Our Story</h2>
              <p>
                <Logo textOnly={true} /> was born from a simple desire: to create beautiful, functional 
                cases that protect your most important devices while expressing your unique 
                style. What started as a student's creative hobby in Szada, Hungary, has 
                grown into a passion for crafting one-of-a-kind pieces that bring joy to 
                everyday technology use.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each case tells a story through carefully chosen patterns, premium materials, 
                and meticulous attention to detail. We believe that the items you carry 
                should be as unique and special as you are.

              <p>
                Behind every <Logo textOnly={true} /> case is a passionate student from Szada, Hungary, 
                who discovered her love for textile arts and handmade craftsmanship during 
                her studies. What started as a creative outlet has grown into a meaningful 
                pursuit that combines her artistic vision with functional design.
              </p>
              <p>
                Her journey began with experimenting with different fabrics and patterns 
                as a hobby, but she found her true calling in creating protective cases 
                that combine beauty with functionality. Each case is carefully planned, 
                cut, sewn, and finished by hand in her studio in Szada, Hungary.
